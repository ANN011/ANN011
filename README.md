# Geo Reference Image Tool

A geo-reference Image tool is a fundamental feature in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that facilitates the alignment of digital geographic data with real-world coordinates on the Earth's surface. Geo-referencing allows users to accurately position and integrate various types of spatial data, such as maps, satellite images, aerial photographs, and survey data, within a common geographic framework.
